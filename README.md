# Web Audio API Demo Base
This repo represents the starting point for a public demo of Javascript's Web Audio API. Prewritten things are:

- HTML so it's set up for a canvas, an audio tag with included audio, and a div to insert sliders in to
- Code to set up a visualizer to use to show off the frequency response of the audio to demonstrate what different effects have visually as well as aurally
- Code to create a slider quickly and add it to the DOM so relevant audio filter values can be modified on the fly easily
- Code to fetch the impulse response for reverb

All of this code is to either get past initial setup or to allow for a faster starting point for the demo. They're unnecessary to work with the Web Audio API and just allow for easier, more visually exciting live coding.
